# Ping

Ping selected device with Find my, will work with devices accessible through icloud, don't know it works with different siri being in different languages. Using siri cause Find my does not have an internal or external API.

To get it to work ether change the shortcut this extension uses or change the siri shortcut, currently its cmd+f13. 

You also may need to change name to reflect the ones in your icloud.
