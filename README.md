# Ping


Ping selected device with Find My. Works with devices accessible through iCloud. Note: Different Siri languages may require adjustments. This extension uses Siri because Find My does not have an internal or external API.

To get it to work, either change the shortcut this extension uses or change the Siri shortcut. Currently it's `cmd+f13`.
You may also need to change the name to the exact name to match the ones in your iCloud account. 
Works for most people with just "Iphone" but might be a problem if you have multiple "Iphones"...
